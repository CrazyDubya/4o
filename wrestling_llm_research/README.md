# Research on Small Language Models for Wrestling Personas and Roles

## Introduction

This document outlines research into identifying small language models (SLMs) with fewer than 13 billion parameters that are suitable for fine-tuning. The goal is to adapt these models to understand and generate text specific to the domain of professional wrestling, including its various roles (e.g., promoter, valet, wrestler, referee, announcer) and even specific character personalities. This research covers potential base models, fine-tuning methodologies, data considerations, and potential challenges.

*Note: The field of LLMs is rapidly evolving. Newer models or versions may become available, and parameter counts can sometimes be approximate or vary based on specific model checkpoints.*

## Fine-Tuning Methodologies

Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained language model to a specific task or domain. For creating a wrestling-focused LLM, several methodologies can be considered:

1.  **Full Fine-Tuning:**
    *   **Description:** This involves retraining all the parameters of the pre-trained model on a new dataset specific to the target domain (in this case, wrestling).
    *   **Pros:** Can lead to the best performance if sufficient data and computational resources are available, as the entire model adapts to the new information.
    *   **Cons:** Computationally expensive and requires a large, high-quality dataset. For SLMs, this might be more feasible than for very large LLMs, but it's still resource-intensive.

2.  **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):**
    *   **Description:** These methods aim to reduce the computational cost of fine-tuning by only updating a small subset of the model's parameters, or by adding a small number of new parameters.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):** LoRA involves injecting trainable rank decomposition matrices into the Transformer layers. It significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters and makes fine-tuning much faster and less memory-intensive. The Hugging Face `peft` library provides tools for LoRA.
        *   **Adapter Layers:** Small neural network layers are inserted into the original model's architecture. Only the parameters of these adapter layers are trained.
        *   **Prompt Tuning:** Instead of tuning the model's weights, this method learns a set of "soft prompts" (continuous vector embeddings) that are prepended to the input to guide the model's behavior for a specific task.
    *   **Pros:** Much lower computational requirements, faster training, smaller storage footprint for the fine-tuned components (as the base model remains unchanged).
    *   **Cons:** May not achieve the same level of performance as full fine-tuning for highly complex adaptations, but often provides a very good balance.

**Application to Wrestling Personas:**

*   The choice of method depends on the available resources and the desired level of specialization.
*   **LoRA** is a particularly promising PEFT technique for this task due to its efficiency and effectiveness. It allows for creating multiple specialized "persona" adaptations from a single base SLM without needing to store many full-sized models.
*   The Llama Cookbook, specifically recipes like "Fine-tune a RAFT chatbot with Llama," demonstrates practical fine-tuning approaches (often using PEFT techniques) that can serve as a template. While these recipes might use specific Llama models, the underlying principles of data preparation, training loops, and evaluation are broadly applicable to other transformer-based SLMs.

## Data Requirements for Fine-Tuning

The quality and nature of the dataset are crucial for successful fine-tuning. To create an LLM specialized in wrestling and its various personas, the following types of data would be highly beneficial:

1.  **Promo Scripts and Transcripts:**
    *   **Content:** Monologues and dialogues from wrestlers, managers, promoters, and other personalities. This data captures the unique speaking styles, catchphrases, and narrative arcs.
    *   **Sources:** Wrestling show transcripts, official publications, fan transcriptions, interviews.

2.  **Match Commentary Transcripts:**
    *   **Content:** Play-by-play and color commentary from announcers. This provides insight into match narration, move names, storytelling within matches, and role-specific language (e.g., face/heel bias for color commentators).
    *   **Sources:** Transcripts of wrestling broadcasts.

3.  **Character Dialogues and Biographies:**
    *   **Content:** Detailed backstories, character motivations, relationships, and typical dialogue patterns for specific wrestlers or personas.
    *   **Sources:** Wrestling encyclopedias, character profiles from games, fan wikis, storyline summaries.

4.  **Kayfabe Narratives and Storyline Summaries:**
    *   **Content:** Text describing the fictional storylines, feuds, and dramatic developments within wrestling promotions.
    *   **Sources:** News articles (respecting kayfabe), historical wrestling websites, official storyline recaps.

5.  **Role-Specific Corpora:**
    *   **Content:** To fine-tune for specific roles like a promoter, referee, or valet, datasets focused purely on their typical language and interactions would be ideal. For example:
        *   **Promoter:** Announcements, interview segments, rule explanations.
        *   **Referee:** Match calls, interactions with wrestlers, rule enforcement dialogue.
        *   **Valet/Manager:** Ringside interjections, interviews alongside their client, promo segments.

**Key Considerations for Data:**

*   **Quality over Quantity (to an extent):** While a large dataset is good, clean, well-formatted, and domain-accurate data is more important. Noise or inaccuracies in the data can lead to poor performance.
*   **Diversity:** The data should cover a wide range of wrestling eras, styles, and characters if a broad understanding is desired. For specific persona tuning, the data should be highly focused on that persona.
*   **Formatting:** Consistent formatting (e.g., speaker identification, clear dialogue turns) helps the model learn patterns effectively. Instruction-based formatting (e.g., `[PROMPT]How would a heel wrestler respond to losing a match?[RESPONSE]They'd complain about a fast count!`) can be very effective for teaching specific response styles.
*   **Rights and Ethics:** Ensure that the data used is ethically sourced and respects copyright and privacy concerns.

## Role-Specific and Character-Specific Fine-Tuning

Beyond a general understanding of wrestling, fine-tuning can be targeted to create LLMs that embody specific roles or even individual character personalities.

**1. Role-Specific Fine-Tuning:**

This involves creating distinct model variations (or applying specific LoRA adapters) for different roles within the wrestling ecosystem. The goal is for the LLM to generate text consistent with the typical language, knowledge, and function of that role.

*   **Promoter:** The model should be able to generate announcements, hype upcoming events, explain stipulations, and conduct formal interviews. Data would include promos from figures like Vince McMahon, Tony Khan, or historical promoters.
*   **Valet/Manager:** The model should excel at speaking on behalf of a client, interfering in promos, and adding color to their wrestler's persona. Data would include interviews and ringside commentary from famous managers like Bobby Heenan, Paul Heyman, or Sherri Martel.
*   **Wrestler (Face/Heel):** This is a broad category. Further sub-division by archetype (e.g., powerhouse heel, underdog face, comedic wrestler) might be beneficial. Data would be wrestler promos, interviews, and even in-ring trash talk, segmented by their alignment and character type.
*   **Referee:** The model would focus on match-related calls, rule explanations, and interactions with wrestlers during a match. Data would be transcripts of referee interactions and rulebooks.
*   **Announcer (Play-by-Play & Color Commentator):**
    *   **Play-by-Play:** Needs to call moves accurately, build excitement, and follow the narrative of a match. Data: Jim Ross, Mauro Ranallo.
    *   **Color Commentator:** Needs to provide analysis, express bias (often based on heel/face dynamics), and tell stories related to characters. Data: Jerry Lawler, Corey Graves.

**Methodology:**
*   Curate distinct datasets for each role.
*   Train separate LoRA adapters for each role using a common base SLM. This is efficient as the base model's general language capabilities are preserved, and only the role-specific nuances are learned by the adapter.
*   Alternatively, perform full fine-tuning if resources permit and a very high degree of specialization is needed for a particular role.

**2. Character-Specific Fine-Tuning:**

This is a more granular level of specialization, aiming to make the LLM adopt the unique personality, catchphrases, history, and speaking style of a *specific* wrestling character (e.g., Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Becky Lynch, a custom character for an agent-guided wrestler).

**Methodology:**
*   **Highly Specific Datasets:** Collect all available promos, interviews, and even notable social media interactions for that single character. The dataset will be smaller than a general role dataset, making quality and representativeness paramount.
*   **LoRA Fine-Tuning:** Train a LoRA adapter specifically for that character on top of a general wrestling-aware base model or a role-specific model (e.g., fine-tune a "heel wrestler" model further to become a specific heel character).
*   **Prompt Engineering / Few-Shot Learning:** Even with fine-tuning, effective prompting that includes examples of the character's speech (few-shot) or a detailed persona description in the system prompt can significantly enhance the character's voice.
*   **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO):** For very refined control, advanced techniques could be used where human reviewers rate the model's outputs for character consistency, helping to further align the model.

**Agent-Guided Wrestlers:**
For the use case of an agent guiding a wrestler, a character-specific LLM could be invaluable. It could help:
*   Brainstorm promo ideas consistent with the wrestler's gimmick.
*   Generate draft promo scripts.
*   Practice interview responses.
*   Develop catchphrases.
*   Ensure consistency in the wrestler's portrayal across different media.

This level of fine-tuning requires careful data curation and iterative refinement to capture the nuances of a specific personality effectively.

## Potential Challenges

Developing LLMs fine-tuned for wrestling personas and roles, while promising, comes with several challenges:

1.  **Data Acquisition and Curation:**
    *   **Sufficiency:** Gathering enough high-quality, domain-specific text for each desired role or character can be difficult, especially for less prominent wrestlers or historical figures.
    *   **Quality Control:** Transcripts may contain errors, off-topic discussions, or inconsistent formatting. Cleaning and preparing this data requires significant effort.
    *   **Bias in Data:** Wrestling narratives often involve exaggerated stereotypes or outdated cultural depictions. Care must be taken to ensure the fine-tuning data doesn't lead the LLM to generate harmful or unintentionally offensive content, or to mitigate it if present.
    *   **Rights and Licensing:** Using copyrighted material (e.g., broadcast transcripts, official scripts) requires careful attention to legal and ethical considerations.

2.  **Computational Resources:**
    *   While SLMs are less demanding than their larger counterparts, full fine-tuning can still require substantial GPU resources and time.
    *   PEFT methods like LoRA reduce this burden but still necessitate access to capable hardware.

3.  **Maintaining Character Consistency (The "Kayfabe Barrier"):**
    *   Ensuring the LLM consistently stays "in character" and adheres to the internal logic of wrestling (kayfabe) can be tricky. Models might sometimes break character or introduce real-world knowledge inappropriately.
    *   For specific personas, maintaining a consistent voice, set of knowledge, and history without contradiction is a complex task.

4.  **Evaluation of Persona and Role Adherence:**
    *   Quantitatively measuring how well an LLM embodies a specific wrestling persona or fulfills a role is non-trivial. Standard NLP metrics (like perplexity or BLEU) don't capture stylistic nuances or character consistency.
    *   Subjective human evaluation will likely be necessary, which can be time-consuming and requires clear guidelines.

5.  **Overfitting to Specific Data:**
    *   If the fine-tuning dataset for a specific character is too small or too narrow, the model might overfit, leading to repetitive or overly predictable responses that lack creativity.

6.  **Rapidly Evolving Wrestling Landscape:**
    *   Characters, storylines, and even wrestling terminology change. Keeping the LLM's knowledge base up-to-date would require ongoing retraining or a mechanism for continuous learning.

7.  **Ethical Considerations of Persona Emulation:**
    *   Creating digital versions of real individuals (even fictionalized wrestling personas) raises ethical questions about consent, representation, and potential misuse.

Addressing these challenges will require careful planning, robust data pipelines, iterative experimentation, and potentially a combination of automated and human-in-the-loop processes.

## Conclusion

Identifying and fine-tuning Small Language Models (SLMs) under 13 billion parameters presents a viable pathway to creating specialized AI tools for the professional wrestling domain. Models such as **Mistral 7B**, **Llama3.2-1B**, **Gemma 9B/4B**, and **Phi-3.5-Mini-3.8B** offer a good balance of capability and manageable size, making them strong candidates for this endeavor.

The most promising fine-tuning approach for developing wrestling-specific personas and roles, especially when targeting multiple distinct characters or functions, is likely to be **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**, with **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** standing out due to its efficiency in terms of computational resources and ability to create multiple adaptations from a single base model.

Success heavily relies on the **curation of high-quality, domain-specific datasets**. This includes promo transcripts, match commentary, character dialogues, and kayfabe narratives, tailored to the general wrestling domain and further refined for specific roles and individual characters. The process will involve careful data preparation, iterative training, and robust evaluation, likely including human assessment, to ensure authenticity and consistency.

While challenges such as data acquisition, maintaining character consistency (the "kayfabe barrier"), and ethical considerations are significant, they are not insurmountable. By leveraging existing open-source SLMs and efficient fine-tuning techniques, it is feasible to develop AI agents that can understand, generate, and interact within the unique context of professional wrestling, offering valuable tools for content creation, fan engagement, and even training and development for wrestling talent.

Further research could explore multi-modal SLMs to incorporate visual elements (like wrestler appearances or in-ring action) and more advanced methods for continuous learning to keep the models updated with the evolving wrestling landscape.
